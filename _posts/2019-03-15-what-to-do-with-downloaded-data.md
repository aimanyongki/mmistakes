So I have already downloaded the Landsat data from [https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/). 
Whats next?

If we extract the Landsat data, it consists of several data, asssociated with several bands recorder by sensor. 
It is important to understand the difference among them.
