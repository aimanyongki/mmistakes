## Raster Data
### Image Data
An image is a digital picture or representation of an object. Image data consist only of numbers. Each number in an image file is a data file value. 
Data file values are sometimes referred to as pixels. The data file value is the measured brightness value of the pixel at a specific wavelength.
Raster image data are laid out in a grid similar to the squarges on a checkerboard. Each cell of the grid is represented by a pixel, also known as a grid cell.
In remotely sensed image data, each pixel represents an area of the Earth at a specific location. The data file value assigned to that pixel is the record of reflected radiation or emitted heat from the Earthâ€™s surface at that location.
