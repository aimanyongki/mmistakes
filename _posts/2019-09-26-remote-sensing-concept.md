## Raster Data
### Image Data
An image is a digital picture or representation of an object. Image data consist only of numbers. Each number in an image file is a data file value. Data file values are sometimes referred to as pixels. The data file value is the measured brightness value of the pixel at a specific wavelength.<br>
Raster image data are laid out in a grid similar to the squarges on a checkerboard. Each cell of the grid is represented by a pixel, also known as a grid cell.<br>
In remotely sensed image data, each pixel represents an area of the Earth at a specific location. The data file value assigned to that pixel is the record of reflected radiation or emitted heat from the Earthâ€™s surface at that location.

#### _Bands_
Each band is a set of data file values for a specific portion of the electromagnetic spectrum of reflected light or emitted heat (red, green, blue, near-infrared, infrared, thermal, and so forth) or some other user-defined information created by combining or enhancing the original bands, or creating new bands from other sources. <br>

##### Numeral Types
The range and the type of numbers used in a raster layer determine how the layer is displayed and processed. For example, a layer of elevation data with values ranging from -51.257 to 553.401 would be treated differently from a layer using only two values to show land and water.<br>
