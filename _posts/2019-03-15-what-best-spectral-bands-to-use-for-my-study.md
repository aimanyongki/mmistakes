Next question is what are the best spectral bands we should use for our study?


Some will argue that the level of detail or **spatial resolution** is the most important aspect of viewing a satellite image. 

However, 

it is also useful to understand how **changes in irradiative energy** reflected by different surface materials are used to identify features of interest.
