Next question is what are the best spectral bands we should use for our study?


Some will argue that the level of detail or **spatial resolution** is the most important aspect of viewing a satellite image. 

However, 

it is also useful to understand how **changes in irradiative energy** reflected by different surface materials are used to identify features of interest.

Band | Wavelength | Useful for Mapping: 
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Band 1 – Coastal Aerosol | 0.435 - 0.451 | Coastal and aerosol studies
Band 2 – Blue | 0.452 - 0.512 | Bathymetric mapping, distinguishing soil from vegetation, and deciduous from coniferous vegetation
Band 3 - Green | 0.533 - 0.590 | Emphasizes peak vegetation, which is useful for assessing plant vigor
Band 4 - Red | 0.636 - 0.673 | Discriminates vegetation slopes
Band 5 - Near Infrared (NIR) | 0.851 - 0.879 | Emphasizes biomass content and shorelines
Band 6 - Short-wave Infrared (SWIR) 1 | 1.566 - 1.651 | Discriminates moisture content of soil and vegetation; penetrates thin clouds
Band 7 - Short-wave Infrared (SWIR) 2 | 2.107 - 2.294 | Improved moisture content of soil and vegetation and thin cloud penetration
Band 8 - Panchromatic | 0.503 - 0.676 | 15 meter resolution, sharper image definition
Band 9 – Cirrus | 1.363 - 1.384 | Improved detection of cirrus cloud contamination
Band 10 – TIRS 1 | 10.60 – 11.19 | 100 meter resolution, thermal mapping and estimated soil moisture
Band 11 – TIRS 2 | 11.50 - 12.51 | 100 meter resolution, Improved thermal mapping and estimated soil moisture
